# UserProfile Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the complete UserProfile functionality from frontend to backend to database.

## Prerequisites

1. **Supabase Project**: You need a Supabase project with your credentials
2. **Environment Variables**: Your `.env` file should contain Supabase URL and Key
3. **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Database Setup

**Location**: Supabase SQL Editor

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy the entire content from `supabase/fix-userprofile.sql`
4. Paste it in the SQL Editor
5. Click "Run"

This will:
- Create the `avatars` storage bucket
- Set up storage policies
- Insert sample data (institutions, users, social links)
- Configure everything needed for UserProfile

### Step 2: Test the Setup

**Location**: Project root directory

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
node test-userprofile.js
```

You should see:
- âœ… Environment variables found
- âœ… Found test users
- âœ… Found social links
- âœ… Found institutions
- âœ… Found user-institution relationships
- âœ… Avatars storage bucket found
- âœ… User data accessible

### Step 2.5: Test Real-time Updates

**Location**: Project root directory

Run the real-time test script to verify database-to-frontend sync:

```bash
node test-realtime-updates.js
```

This will:
- Set up real-time subscriptions
- Update data in the database
- Show real-time update messages
- Verify that changes are detected automatically

### Step 2.6: Add Machine Learning Course

**Location**: Supabase SQL Editor

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy the entire content from `supabase/add-machine-learning-course.sql`
4. Paste it in the SQL Editor
5. Click "Run"

This will:
- Create the "Machine Learning" course
- Add 4 chapters with content items
- Enroll the test student as completed
- Mark all content as 100% completed
- Add a 5-star review
- Assign the teacher to the course

### Step 2.7: Test the Course Setup

**Location**: Project root directory

Run the course test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
node test-machine-learning-course.js
```

You should see:
- âœ… Course found with all details
- âœ… Course tags (machine-learning, algorithms, data-science, etc.)
- âœ… 4 chapters created
- âœ… 7 content items created
- âœ… Student enrollment as completed
- âœ… All progress marked as completed
- âœ… 5-star course review
- âœ… Teacher assigned to course

### Step 3: Start the Development Server

**Location**: Project root directory

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test the UserProfile Component

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Navigate to the UserProfile page
3. Click "Edit Profile" to test editing functionality
4. Try uploading a profile picture
5. Add/edit social media links
6. Update notification preferences
7. Save changes

## What's Fixed

### âœ… Database Issues
- Fixed the relationship query between `users` and `institutions`
- Properly fetches user data and institution data separately
- Combines data correctly for the frontend

### âœ… Storage Issues
- Created `avatars` storage bucket
- Set up proper storage policies
- Fixed profile picture upload functionality

### âœ… Frontend Issues
- Updated `useAuth` hook to work with existing schema
- Created `useUserProfile` hook for better organization
- Completely rewrote `UserProfile` component
- Fixed all form handling and data management

### âœ… Image Issues
- Replaced broken placeholder images with working ones
- Used `ui-avatars.com` for reliable placeholder images

## File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useAuth.tsx              # Updated authentication hook
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useUserProfile.tsx       # New UserProfile hook
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useCompletedCourses.tsx  # New completed courses hook
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Profile/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ UserProfile.tsx      # Completely rewritten component
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Dashboard/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ CompletedCourses.tsx # New completed courses component
supabase/
â”œâ”€â”€ fix-userprofile.sql                    # Database setup script
â””â”€â”€ add-machine-learning-course.sql        # Course setup script
test-userprofile.js                        # Test script
test-machine-learning-course.js            # Course test script
```

## Features Working

âœ… **Profile Data Loading**: User information loads from database
âœ… **Profile Editing**: All fields are editable
âœ… **Profile Picture Upload**: File upload to Supabase storage
âœ… **Social Media Links**: Add, edit, delete social links
âœ… **Notification Preferences**: Toggle email, push, SMS notifications
âœ… **Real-time Updates**: All changes save to database immediately
âœ… **Database to Frontend Sync**: Changes made in database reflect on frontend automatically
âœ… **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and fallbacks
âœ… **Loading States**: Loading spinners and disabled states

## Troubleshooting

### If you see errors:

1. **"Missing environment variables"**
   - Check your `.env` file has `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

2. **"Table not accessible"**
   - Run the SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor

3. **"Storage bucket not found"**
   - The SQL script creates the bucket, make sure it ran successfully

4. **"Profile not loading"**
   - Check the test script output for specific errors
   - Verify your Supabase project is active

### Common Issues:

- **RLS Policies**: The setup uses your existing schema with RLS disabled for development
- **Image Upload**: Make sure files are under 5MB and are valid image types
- **Social Links**: Each platform can only have one link per user

## Next Steps

After setup is complete:

1. Test all functionality thoroughly
2. Customize the UI as needed
3. Add additional fields if required
4. Set up proper RLS policies for production

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Run the test script first: `node test-userprofile.js`
2. Check the browser console for errors
3. Verify your Supabase project settings
4. Ensure all SQL scripts ran successfully

The UserProfile should now work perfectly with your existing database schema! ðŸŽ‰
