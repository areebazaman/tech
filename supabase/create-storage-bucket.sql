-- Manual Storage Bucket Creation for TeachMe.ai
-- =====================================================

-- Step 1: Create the avatars storage bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'avatars',
  'avatars',
  true,
  5242880, -- 5MB limit
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif', 'image/webp']
) ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Step 2: Create storage policies for the avatars bucket

-- Policy 1: Allow authenticated users to upload their own profile pictures
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own profile pictures" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Policy 2: Allow public read access to profile pictures
CREATE POLICY "Public read access to profile pictures" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Policy 3: Allow users to update their own profile pictures
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile pictures" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Policy 4: Allow users to delete their own profile pictures
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile pictures" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Step 3: Verify the bucket was created
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE name = 'avatars';
